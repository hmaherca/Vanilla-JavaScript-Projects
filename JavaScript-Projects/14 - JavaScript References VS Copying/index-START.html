    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age =200
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name ='hisham'
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name='maher'
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);


    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3]='lux'
    console.log(team, players)
    // this will change both the 'team' array and the 'players' array
    // because team is using players as a refence so it will go back to the priginal and change it
    //earlier we did the same with strings numbers and booleans which did not affect the original

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2=players.slice()
    // using the slice method without passing it any values will just make a caopy of the array
  
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3=[].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4=[...players];
    team4[3]='moe'
    console.log(team4, players)

    const team5=Array.from(players)
    //used this from hangman and other projects
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number=99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person,{number:99});
    console.log(cap2)
    // here we are decalring a new constant, it will be an object that we use the assign method on which will copy another object and add the keyvalue pair we want which here is number:99

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const Hisham ={
      name:'hisham',
      age: 100,
      social:{
        twitter: 'none',
        facebook:'hishamaher'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
  console.log(Hisham);
  const dev= Object.assign({},Hisham);
  // here you will only be able to copy one level deep
  //do this instead for the entiore thing
  const dev2=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(Hisham))
  //here we are turning the original object into a string and then immediatly turing it back into an object therefore making a copy of the whole thing.
  // now we can go back into dev2 and add and remove key value pairs as we please without modifying the original object Hisham
